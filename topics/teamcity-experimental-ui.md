[//]: # (auxiliary-id: TeamCity Experimental UI)

In version 2019.1, TeamCity introduced an experimental UI option as an alternative to the classic UI. Our experimental UI is a work in progress: we present the changes in functionality in the early stages of development so you can benefit from the new features as soon as possible. Based on our vision and your feedback, we are constantly releasing new UI features and improving existing ones.
 
Our goal is to provide a support for all the important classic features in the new UI before making it a default option. However, many users of TeamCity have successfully switched to the new UI already and use it in terms of their production pipeline.   
We encourage you to try the TeamCity experimental UI and leave your feedback via our [UI survey](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/feedback-form-for-teamcity?tcv=2019.2).

## Enabling and disabling experimental UI

When you sign in to TeamCity for the first time, it automatically offers you to switch to the experimental UI and remembers your choice.

You can change the default UI representation anytime in __My Settings & Tools | General__ via the _Use experimental UI_ checkbox.
 
Any page that supports an experimental UI has a toggle that allows quickly accessing a UI mode alternative to the default one. For example, if you miss any of the familiar classic options in the new UI, you can switch the page to the classic UI with the ![mammoth.png](mammoth.png) button. To return to the experimental UI, click ![tube.png](tube.png).

## Available features of experimental UI

Currently, the experimental UI is available for the following pages:
* __Build Configuration Home__ and __Project Home__ pages with the redesigned __Overview__ tab
* __Build Details__ page with revamped __Overview__, __Tests__, and __Dependencies__ tabs
* __Agents__ page with the preview and statistics of all available agents

Each experimental page comes with a handy __sidebar__ that serves for quick navigation and preview of build/agent statuses.

Below, you can find a recap of these features. Please note that the described functionality is a work in progress. In case you face any unpredictable behavior in the new UI, feel free to contact us via our [feedback channels](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/Feedback).

### Experimental Project Home page

The __Overview__ tab of the experimental __Project Home__ page strives to provide more visibility of the project's nested subprojects and build configurations. The page comes with a sidebar, listing all the projects available to the current user, and has two main views: __Builds__ and __Trends__.

The __Builds__ view resembles the classic UI and displays a list of last builds in subprojects and build configurations of the current project.

The __Trends__ view comprises cards that represent build configurations, grouped by their projects. Each card contains a preview of the most recent builds displayed as bars on a timescale. You can hover over any bar to instantly see more information about the build: its duration, queue statistics, test results, used agent, and more. The card also displays the number of pending changes.

The __Trends__ view of the __Project Overview__:

All the classic UI tabs are also available on the experimental page: click __More__ and select the required tab in the list.

### Experimental Build Configuration Home page

The __Overview__ tab of the experimental __Build Home__ page provides two already familiar views: __Builds__, listing all the last builds of the configuration, and __Branches__, listing the most recent builds in active branches.

Every build item in the list is expandable: click it to preview the important information about the build and get quick access to any of the __Build Details__ tabs.

Click a specific build problem or failed test to see the related stack trace: <img src="exp-failed-test-preview.png" alt="Failed test preview"/>

Click __Open in build log__ to open the new reworked build log exactly at the line where the problem occurred. 

The _Changes_ pop-up block has also been reworked. Now, build changes are sorted chronologically and grouped by their origin: user commits to the code and changes in artifact dependencies. You can also filter the changes by their author and display changes made in the build configuration settings.

Examples of the _Changes_ pop-up block:

All the classic UI tabs of __Build Configuration Home__ are also available on the experimental page: click __More__ and select the required tab in the list.

### Experimental Build Details page

The new __Build Details__ page offers better visualization of the build results and provides a few handy widgets.

With the __Trends__ block, you can instantly preview all the previous builds and their details, without leaving the current build page:

<img src="build-trends-preview.png" width="250" alt="Build trends preview"/>

A visualized build timeline reflects the duration of each stage and indicates build problems:

<img src="build-timeline.png" width="600" alt="Build timeline"/>

Click any stage to open the corresponding line of the build log. In the new UI, even a long log can be displayed directly in the preview, with no need to download it.

<tip>

The __Actions__ menu offers a handy new option â€“ __Compare with__. Choose this action to compare the parameters and results of the current build with any other build side-by-side.

</tip>

Apart from the __Overview__ tab, you can use the revamped __Changes__, __Tests__, and __Dependencies__ tabs. Other classic UI tabs are also available: click __More__ and select the required tab in the list.

The __Changes__ tab displays more information about changes in the build, separately for user commits and artifact changes. You can filter changes by its author and display changes made in the build configuration settings.
The __Tests__ tab allows switching between failed, ignored, and succeeded tests. Click a test to quickly view its details and assign an investigation.   
The __Dependencies__ tab provides three alternative modes of displaying the build dependencies: visual timeline, structured list, and build chain. Choose the mode that is more helpful for your current task.

### Experimental Agents page

The experimental __Agents__ page loads faster for a large number of agents and allows quickly switching between agent details.

### Experimental sidebar

The experimental sidebar is available for the project hierarchy and agent hierarchy. Depending on the currently open page, it serves for better navigation between either projects, build configurations, or build agents.

#### Projects sidebar

The _Projects_ sidebar contains a list of all the projects available to the current user of TeamCity and allows searching them by name. You can expand any project to see the statuses of it nested subprojects and build configurations and quickly switch between them.

Additionally, the sidebar allows accessing the __Favorite projects__ and __Favorite builds__ views with the lists of your favorite projects and favorite build configurations respectively.

#### Agents sidebar

The _Agents_ sidebar allows browsing the agent pool hierarchy and searching agents and pools by name. The __Overview__ view provides statistics about all the agents on the server.

## Roadmap

The next improvements of the experimental UI will address the following areas:
* Build Queue page
* Sidebar and Header areas
* Mutes/Investigations pages
